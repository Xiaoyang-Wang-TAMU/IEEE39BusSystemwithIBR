# IEEE39BusSystemwithIBR
IEEE 39 bus system with 100% IBR (4GFM and 6GFL)
This is the Simulink Model (Matlab Simlink R2024a) used in the paper:
**Xiaoyang Wang*, Xin Chen, “Distributed Coordination of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverters for Optimal Frequency Control in Power Systems“, arXiv:2411.12682, 2025.**
The model inclue 10 IBRs (4GFM and 6GFL).
The proposed optimnal secondary frequency is excuted in
