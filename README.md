# IEEE39BusSystemwithIBR
IEEE 39 bus system with 100% IBR (4GFM and 6GFL)
This is the Simulink Model (Matlab Simlink R2024a) used in the paper:

****Xiaoyang Wang*, Xin Chen, “Distributed Coordination of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverters for Optimal Frequency Control in Power Systems“, arXiv:2411.12682, 2025.***

The model includes 10 IBRs (4GFM and 6GFL). All IBR is built based on full order model. 
The proposed optimnal secondary frequency is excuted in the model: **IEEE39IBR_ProposedOFC/IEEE39_IBR_FrequencyControl_Fullversion_Opensource.slx**

The benchmark model which does not include the proposed secondary frequency and only includes the primary frequency control is excuted in the model: 
**IEEE39IBR_Primary/IEEE39_IBR_FrequencyControl_Primary**
